msgid "OnionShare has an open Keybase team that we use to discuss the project, including asking questions, sharing ideas and designs, and making plans for future development. (It's also an easy way to send end-to-end encrypted direct messages to others in the OnionShare community, like OnionShare addresses.) To use Keybase, you need to download the `Keybase app <https://keybase.io/download>`_, make an account, and `join this team <https://keybase.io/team/onionshare>`_. Within the app, go to Teams, click \"Join a Team\", and type \"onionshare\"."
