Getting Help
============

Read This Website
-----------------

You will find instructions on how to use OnionShare. Look through all of the sections first to see if anything answers your questions.

Check the GitHub Issues
-----------------------

If it isn't on the website, please check the `GitHub issues <https://github.com/onionshare/onionshare/issues>`_. It's possible someone else has encountered the same problem and either raised it with the developers, or maybe even posted a solution.

Submit an Issue Yourself
------------------------

If you are unable to find a solution, or wish to ask a question or suggest a new feature, please `submit an issue <https://github.com/onionshare/onionshare/issues/new>`_. This requires `creating a GitHub account <https://help.github.com/articles/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account/>`_.

Join our Keybase Team
---------------------

See :ref:`collaborating` on how to join the Keybase team used to discuss the project.
