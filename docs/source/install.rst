Installing OnionShare
=====================

Windows and macOS
-----------------

You can always get the latest version of OnionShare for Windows and macOS from `onionshare.org <https://onionshare.org/>`_.

You can find old versions of OnionShare for Windows and macOS from https://onionshare.org/dist/.

Linux
-----

Many Linux distributions come with OnionShare in their package repositories. You can use these if you want, but they might be old.

If you want to make sure you have the latest version with support for the most features, you should use the Flatpak package. The Flatpak package is also more secure because it always uses the most up-to-date dependencies and runs OnionShare inside of a sandbox.

**To install OnionShare using Flatpak:** Make sure you have ``flatpak`` installed and the Flathub repository added by following `these instructions <https://flatpak.org/setup/>`_ for your Linux distribution. Then install OnionShare from Flathub by following `the instructions here <https://flathub.org/apps/details/org.onionshare.OnionShare>`_.
