msgid "This is the default, simplest and most reliable way that OnionShare connects to Tor. For this reason, it's recommended for most users."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/tor.rst:14
msgid "When you open OnionShare, it launches an already configured ``tor`` process in the background for OnionShare to use. It doesn't interfere with other ``tor`` processes on your computer, so you can use the Tor Browser or the system ``tor`` on their own."

msgid "Getting Around Censorship"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/tor.rst:20
msgid "If your access to the internet is censored, you can configure OnionShare to connect to the Tor network using `Tor bridges <https://tb-manual.torproject.org/bridges/>`_. If OnionShare connects to Tor without one, you don't need to use a bridge."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/tor.rst:22
msgid "To use a bridge, open the Tor Settings tab. You must select \"Use the Tor version built into OnionShare\" and check the \"Use a bridge\" checkbox."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/tor.rst:25
msgid "Try using a built-in bridge first. Using `obfs4` or `snowflake` bridges is recommended over using `meek-azure`."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/tor.rst:29
msgid "If using a built-in bridge doesn't work, you can request a bridge from torproject.org. You will have to solve a CAPTCHA in order to request a bridge. (This makes it more difficult for governments or ISPs to block access to Tor bridges.)"

msgid "If you have `downloaded the Tor Browser <https://www.torproject.org>`_ and don't want two ``tor`` processes running, you can use the ``tor`` process from the Tor Browser. Keep in mind you need to keep Tor Browser open in the background while you're using OnionShare for this to work."

msgid "Make up a control port password. (Using 7 words in a sequence like ``comprised stumble rummage work avenging construct volatile`` is a good idea for a password.)
