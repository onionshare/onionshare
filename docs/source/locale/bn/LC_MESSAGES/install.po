msgid "There are various ways to install OnionShare for Linux, but the recommended way is to use either the `Flatpak <https://flatpak.org/>`_ or the `Snap <https://snapcraft.io/>`_ package. Flatpak and Snap ensure that you'll always use the newest version and run OnionShare inside of a sandbox."

msgid "You can verify that the package you download is legitimate and hasn't been tampered with by verifying its PGP signature. For Windows and macOS, this step is optional and provides defense in depth: the OnionShare binaries include operating system-specific signatures, and you can just rely on those alone if you'd like."
