"**Third parties don't have access to anything that happens in OnionShare.** "
"Using OnionShare means hosting services directly on your computer. When "
"sharing files with OnionShare, they are not uploaded to any server. If you "
"make an OnionShare chat room, your computer acts as a server for that too. "
"This avoids the traditional model of having to trust the computers of others."

"**Network eavesdroppers can't spy on anything that happens in OnionShare in "
"transit.** The connection between the Tor onion service and Tor Browser is "
"end-to-end encrypted. This means network attackers can't eavesdrop on "
"anything except encrypted Tor traffic. Even if an eavesdropper is a "
"malicious rendezvous node used to connect the Tor Browser with OnionShare's "
"onion service, the traffic is encrypted using the onion service's private "

"**Communicating the OnionShare address and private key might not be secure."
"** Communicating the OnionShare address to people is the responsibility of "
"the OnionShare user. If sent insecurely (such as through an email message "
"monitored by an attacker), an eavesdropper can tell that OnionShare is being "
"used. If the eavesdropper loads the address in Tor Browser while the service "
"is still up, they can access it. To avoid this, the address must be "
"communicated securely, via encrypted text message (probably with "
"disappearing messages enabled), encrypted email, or in person. This isn't "
"necessary when using OnionShare for something that isn't secret."

"**Communicating the OnionShare address and private key might not be "
"anonymous.** Extra precautions must be taken to ensure the OnionShare "
"address is communicated anonymously. A new email or chat account, only "
"accessed over Tor, can be used to share the address. This isn't necessary "
"unless anonymity is a goal."
