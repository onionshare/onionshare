msgid "Everything in OnionShare is temporary by default. If you close an OnionShare tab, its address no longer exists and it can't be used again. Sometimes you might want an OnionShare service to be persistent. This is useful if you want to host a website available from the same OnionShare address even if you reboot your computer."

msgid "When you quit OnionShare and then open it again, your saved tabs will start opened. You'll have to manually start each service, but when you do they will start with the same OnionShare address and password."

msgid "By default, all OnionShare services are protected with the username ``onionshare`` and a randomly-generated password. If someone takes 20 wrong guesses at the password, your onion service is automatically stopped to prevent a brute force attack against the OnionShare service."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/advanced.rst:31
msgid "Sometimes you might want your OnionShare service to be accessible to the public, like if you want to set up an OnionShare receive service so the public can securely and anonymously send you files. In this case, it's better to disable the password altogether. If you don't do this, someone can force your server to stop just by making 20 wrong guesses of your password, even if they know the correct password."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/advanced.rst:35
msgid "To turn off the password for any tab, just check the \"Don't use a password\" box before starting the server. Then the server will be public and won't have a password."

msgid "OnionShare supports scheduling exactly when a service should start and stop. Before starting a server, click \"Show advanced settings\" in its tab and then check the boxes next to either \"Start onion service at scheduled time\", \"Stop onion service at scheduled time\", or both, and set the respective desired dates and times."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/advanced.rst:43
msgid "If you scheduled a service to start in the future, when you click the \"Start sharing\" button you will see a timer counting down until it starts. If you scheduled it to stop in the future, after it's started you will see a timer counting down to when it will stop automatically."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/advanced.rst:46
msgid "**Scheduling an OnionShare service to automatically start can be used as a dead man's switch**, where your service will be made public at a given time in the future if anything happens to you. If nothing happens to you, you can cancel the service before it's scheduled to start."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/advanced.rst:51
msgid "**Scheduling an OnionShare service to automatically stop can be useful to limit exposure**, like if you want to share secret documents while making sure they're not available on the Internet for more than a few days."

msgid "To use legacy addresses, before starting a server click \"Show advanced settings\" from its tab and check the \"Use a legacy address (v2 onion service, not recommended)\" box. In legacy mode you can optionally turn on Tor client authentication. Once you start a server in legacy mode you cannot remove legacy mode in that tab. Instead you must start a separate service in a separate tab."
