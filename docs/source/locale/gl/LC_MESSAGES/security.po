"**Third parties don't have access to anything that happens in OnionShare.** "
"Using OnionShare means hosting services directly on your computer. When "
"sharing files with OnionShare, they are not uploaded to any server. If you "
"make an OnionShare chat room, your computer acts as a server for that too. "

"**Network eavesdroppers can't spy on anything that happens in OnionShare in "
"transit.** The connection between the Tor onion service and Tor Browser is "
"end-to-end encrypted. This means network attackers can't eavesdrop on "
"anything except encrypted Tor traffic. Even if an eavesdropper is a "
"malicious rendezvous node used to connect the Tor Browser with OnionShare's "
"onion service, the traffic is encrypted using the onion service's private "
"key."

"**Os terceiros non teñen acceso a nada do que ocorre en OnionShare.** Usar "
"OnionShare significa hospedar servizos directamente no teu ordenador. Cando "
"compartelos teus ficheiros con OnionShare, non se cargan a ningún servidor "
"de terceiros. Se creas unha sala de chat de OnionShare, o teu ordenador "
"tamén actúa como un servidor para iso. Isto evita o modelo tradicional de "
"ter que confiar nos ordenadores alleos."

"**Anonymity of OnionShare users are protected by Tor.** OnionShare and Tor "
"Browser protect the anonymity of the users. As long as the OnionShare user "
"anonymously communicates the OnionShare address with the Tor Browser users, "

"OnionShare user."

"**Os fisgones da rede non poden levar a cabo a súa actividade en todolo que "
"ocorre en OnionShare.** A conexión entre o servizo Onion Tor e o navegador "
"Tor está cifrada de extremo a extremo. Isto significa que os atacantes na "
"rede non poden escoitar nada excepto o tráfico Tor cifrado. Aínda que o "
"espía sexa un nodo de encontro malicioso usado para conectar o navegador Tor "
"ao servizo Onion de OnionShare, o tráfico cífrase mediante a clave privada "
"de Onion."

"**Communicating the OnionShare address and private key might not be secure."
"** Communicating the OnionShare address to people is the responsibility of "
"the OnionShare user. If sent insecurely (such as through an email message "
"monitored by an attacker), an eavesdropper can tell that OnionShare is being "
"used. If the eavesdropper loads the address in Tor Browser while the service "
"is still up, they can access it. To avoid this, the address must be "
"communicated securely, via encrypted text message (probably with "
"disappearing messages enabled), encrypted email, or in person. This isn't "
"necessary when using OnionShare for something that isn't secret."
