"**Third parties don't have access to anything that happens in "
"OnionShare.** Using OnionShare means hosting services directly on your "
"computer. When sharing your files with OnionShare, they are not uploaded "
"to any third-party server. If you make an OnionShare chat room, your "
"computer acts as a server for that too. This avoids the traditional model"
" of having to trust the computers of others."

"**Network eavesdroppers can't spy on anything that happens in OnionShare "
"in transit.** The connection between the Tor onion service and Tor "
"Browser is end-to-end encrypted. This means network attackers can't "
"eavesdrop on anything except encrypted Tor traffic. Even if an "
"eavesdropper is a malicious rendezvous node used to connect the Tor "
"Browser with OnionShare's onion service, the traffic is encrypted using "
"the onion service's private key."

"**Os bisbilhoteiros da rede não podem espionar nada que aconteça no "
"OnionShare durante o trânsito.** A conexão entre o serviço onion Tor e o "
"Navegador Tor são criptografadas de ponta-a-ponta. Isso significa que os "
"invasores de rede não podem espionar nada, exceto o tráfego criptografado"
" do Tor. Mesmo se um bisbilhoteiro for um nó de encontro malicioso usado "
"para conectar o navegador Tor ao serviço onion da OnionShare, o tráfego é"
" criptografado usando a chave privada do serviço onion."

"**Anonymity of OnionShare users are protected by Tor.** OnionShare and "

"identity of the OnionShare user."

"**If an attacker learns about the onion service, they still can't access "
"anything.** Prior attacks against the Tor network to enumerate onion "
"services allowed attackers to discover private ``.onion`` addresses. To "
"access an OnionShare service from its address, the private key used for "
"client authentication must be guessed (unless the service is already made"
" public by turning off the private key -- see "
":ref:`turn_off_private_key`)."
msgstr ""
"**Se um atacante tomar conhecimento acerca do onion service, ele ainda "
"não poderá acessar nada.** Ataques anteriores contra a rede Tor para "
"enumerar os serviços permitiram que o atacante descobrisse endereços "
"privados ``.onion```. Se um ataque descobrir um endereço privado do "
"OnionShare, ele também precisará adivinhar a chave privada utilizada para"
" autenticação do cliente para acessá-lo (a menos que o usuário do "

"tell that OnionShare is being used. Eavesdroppers can access services "
"that are still up by loading their addresses and/or lost key in the Tor "

"atacante), um espião pode notar que o OnionShare está sendo usado. Se o "
"espião carregar o endereço no Tor Browser enquanto o serviço ainda "
"estiver ativo, ele poderá acessá-lo. Para evitar isso, o endereço deve "
"ser comunicado com segurança, através de mensagem de texto criptografada "
