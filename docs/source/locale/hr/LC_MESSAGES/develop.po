msgid "OnionShare has an open Keybase team to discuss the project, ask questions, share ideas and designs, and making plans for future development. (It's also an easy way to send end-to-end encrypted direct messages to others in the OnionShare community, like OnionShare addresses.) To use Keybase, download the `Keybase app <https://keybase.io/download>`_, make an account, and `join this team <https://keybase.io/team/onionshare>`_. Within the app, go to \"Teams\", click \"Join a Team\", and type \"onionshare\"."

For example::"
