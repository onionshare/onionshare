msgid "How OnionShare works"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/features.rst:6
msgid "OnionShare works by starting web servers locally on your own computer and making them accessible to other people as `Tor <https://www.torproject.org/>`_ `onion services <https://community.torproject.org/onion-services/>`_."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/features.rst:8
msgid "By default, OnionShare web addresses are protected with a random password. A typical OnionShare address might look something like this::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/features.rst:12
msgid "You're responsible for securely sharing that URL using a communication channel of your choice like in an encrypted chat message, or using something less secure like a Twitter or Facebook message, depending on your `threat model <https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/your-security-plan>`_."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/features.rst:14
msgid "The people who you send the URL to must then copy and paste it into `Tor Browser <https://www.torproject.org/>`_ to access the OnionShare service."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/features.rst:16
msgid "With OnionShare, *your own computer is the web server*. If you run OnionShare on your laptop to send someone files, and then suspend your laptop before the files have been downloaded, the service will not be available until your laptop is unsuspended and connected to the internet again. OnionShare works best when working with people in real-time."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/features.rst:18
msgid "Because your own computer is the web server, *no third party can access anything that happens in OnionShare*, not even the developers of OnionShare. It's completely private. And because OnionShare is based on Tor onion services too, it also protects your anonymity. See the :doc:`security design </security>` for more information."

#: ../../source/features.rst:21
msgid "Share Files"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/features.rst:23
msgid "You can use OnionShare to securely and anonymously send files and folders to people. Just open a share tab, drag in the files and folders you wish to share, and click \"Start sharing\"."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/features.rst:27
#: ../../source/features.rst:91
msgid "After you add files, you'll see some settings. Make sure you choose the setting you're interested in first before you start sharing."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/features.rst:31
msgid "By default, as soon as someone finishes downloading your files, OnionShare will automatically stop the server, completely removing the website from the internet. If you want to allow multiple people to download these files, uncheck the \"Stop sharing after files have been sent (uncheck to allow downloading individual files)\" box."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/features.rst:33
msgid "Also, if you uncheck this box, people will be able to download individual files that you share rather than a single compressed version of all of the files."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/features.rst:35
msgid "When you're ready to share, click the \"Start sharing\" button. You can always click \"Stop sharing\", or quit OnionShare, to immediate take the website down. You can also click the up arrow icon in the top-right corner to show the history and progress of people downloading files from you."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/features.rst:39
msgid "Now that you have a website that's sharing files, copy the address and send it to the person you want to receive the files. If the files need to stay secure, you should use an encrypted messaging app."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/features.rst:41
msgid "That person then must load the address in Tor Browser. After logging in with the random password that's included in the web address, they will be able to download the files directly from your computer by clicking the \"Download Files\" link in the corner."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/features.rst:46
msgid "Receive Files"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/features.rst:48
msgid "You can use OnionShare to let people anonymously upload files directly to your computer, essentially turning it into an anonymous dropbox. Open a receive tab, choose where you want files to get downloaded and other settings, and then click \"Start Receive Mode\"."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/features.rst:52
msgid "This will start the OnionShare service. Anyone that loads this address in Tor Browser will be able to upload files to your computer."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/features.rst:56
msgid "You can also click the down arrow icon in the top-right corner to show the history and progress of people sending files to you."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/features.rst:58
msgid "Here is what it looks like for someone sending you files."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/features.rst:62
msgid "When someone uploads files to your receive service, by default they get saved to a folder called ``OnionShare`` in your home folder on your computer, and they get automatically organized into separate subfolders based on the time that the files get uploaded."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/features.rst:64
msgid "Setting up an OnionShare receiving service is useful for journalists and others that need to securely accept documents from anonymous sources. When used in this way, OnionShare is sort of like a lightweight, simpler, not quite as secure version of `SecureDrop <https://securedrop.org/>`_, the whistleblower submission system."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/features.rst:67
msgid "Use at your own risk"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/features.rst:69
msgid "Just like with malicious email attachments, it's possible that someone could try to hack your computer by uploading a malicious file to your OnionShare service. OnionShare does not add any safety mechanisms to protect your system from malicious files, so use at your own risk."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/features.rst:71
msgid "If you receive an Office document or a PDF through OnionShare, you can convert these documents into PDFs that you know are safe to open using `Dangerzone <https://dangerzone.rocks/>`_. You can also protect yourself when opening untrusted documents by opening them in `Tails <https://tails.boum.org/>`_ or in a `Qubes <https://qubes-os.org/>`_ disposable VM."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/features.rst:74
msgid "Tips for running a receive service"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/features.rst:76
msgid "If you want to host your own anonymous dropbox using OnionShare, it's recommended that you do it on a separate, dedicated computer that's always powered on and connected to the internet, and not on the one you use on a regular basis."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/features.rst:78
msgid "If you intend on advertising the OnionShare address on your website or social media profiles, then you should save the tab (see :ref:`save_tabs`) and run it as a public service (see :ref:`disable_passwords`)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/features.rst:81
msgid "Host a Website"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/features.rst:83
msgid "You can use OnionShare to host a static HTML website with just a click. Just open a website tab, drag in the files and folders that make up the static website, and click when you're ready click \"Start sharing\"."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/features.rst:87
msgid "If you add an ``index.html`` file, when someone loads your website it will render this page. You should also include any other HTML files, CSS files, JavaScript files, and images that make up the website. (Note that OnionShare only supports hosting *static* websites. It can't host websites that execute code or use databases. So you can't, for example, use WordPress.)"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/features.rst:89
msgid "If you don't have an ``index.html`` file, then it will show a directory listing instead, and people who load it can look through the files and download them."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/features.rst:96
msgid "Content Security Policy"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/features.rst:98
msgid "By default OnionShare will help secure your website by setting a strict `Content Security Police <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_Security_Policy>`_ header. However this will prevent third-party content from loading inside the web page."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/features.rst:100
msgid "If you want to load content from third-party websites, like assets or JavaScript libraries from CDNs, then you must check the \"Disable Content Security Policy header (allows your website to use third-party resources)\" box before starting the service."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/features.rst:103
msgid "Tips for running a website service"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/features.rst:105
msgid "If you want to host a long-term website using OnionShare (that isn't just to quickly show someone something), it's recommended that you do it on a separate, dedicated computer that's always powered on and connected to the internet, and not on the one you use on a regular basis. You should also save the tab (see :ref:`save_tabs`) so that you can resume the website with the same address if you close OnionShare and re-open it later."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/features.rst:107
msgid "If your website is intended to be viewed by the public, you should run it as a public service (see :ref:`disable_passwords`)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/features.rst:110
msgid "Chat Anonymously"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/features.rst:112
msgid "You can use OnionShare to set up a completely anonymous, secure chat room that doesn't log anything or leave any traces. Just open a chat tab and click \"Start chat server\"."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/features.rst:116
msgid "After you start the server, copy the OnionShare address and send it to the people who will join this anonymous chat room. If it's important to limit exactly who can join, you should use an encrypted messaging app to send the OnionShare address."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/features.rst:120
msgid "People can join the chat room by loading its OnionShare address in Tor Browser. The chat room requires JavasScript, so everyone who wants to participate must set their security level to Standard or Safer instead of Safest."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/features.rst:122
msgid "When someone joins the chat room they get assigned a random name. They can change their name by typing a new name in the box in the left panel and pressing enter. No chat history will get displayed at all, even if others were already chatting in the room, because the chat history isn't saved anywhere."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/features.rst:126
msgid "In an OnionShare chat room, everyone is anonymous. Anyone can change their name to anything, and there is no way to confirm anyone's identity."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/features.rst:128
msgid "However, if you create an OnionShare chat room and securely send the address only to a small group of trusted friends using encrypted messages, then you can be reasonably confident that the people who join the chat room are your friends."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/features.rst:131
msgid "How is this useful?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/features.rst:133
msgid "If you need to already be using an encrypted messaging app, what's the point of an OnionShare chat room to begin with? It leaves less traces."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/features.rst:135
msgid "If you send a message to a Signal group, for example, a copy of your message ends up on each device (the phones and computers, if they set up Signal Desktop) of each member of the group. Even if disappearing messages is enabled, it's hard to confirm that all copies of the messages were actually deleted from all devices, and from any other places (like notifications databases) they may have been saved to. OnionShare chat rooms don't store any messages anywhere, so this isn't a problem."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/features.rst:137
msgid "OnionShare chat rooms can also be useful for anonymous people wanting to chat securely with someone without needing to create any accounts. For example, a source can send an OnionShare address to a journalist using a disposable email address, and then wait for the journalist to join the chat room, all without compromosing their anonymity."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/features.rst:140
msgid "How does the encryption work?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/features.rst:142
msgid "Because OnionShare relies on Tor onion services, connections between Tor Browser and OnionShare are all end-to-end encrypted (E2EE). When someone posts a message to an OnionShare chat room, they send it to the server through the E2EE onion connection, which then sends it to all other members of the chat room using WebSockets, through their E2EE onion connections."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/features.rst:144
msgid "OnionShare doesn't implement any chat encryption on its own. It relies on the Tor onion service's encryption instead."
msgstr ""
