"Everything in OnionShare is temporary by default. If you close an OnionShare "
"tab, its address no longer exists and it can't be used again. Sometimes you "
"might want an OnionShare service to be persistent. This is useful if you "
"want to host a website available from the same OnionShare address even if "
"you reboot your computer."

"To make any tab persistent, check the \"Save this tab, and automatically "
"open it when I open OnionShare\" box before starting the server. When a tab "

msgstr ""

#: ../../source/advanced.rst:28
msgid ""
"By default, all OnionShare services are protected with the username "
"``onionshare`` and a randomly-generated password. If someone takes 20 wrong "
"guesses at the password, your onion service is automatically stopped to "
"prevent a brute force attack against the OnionShare service."

#: ../../source/advanced.rst:31
msgid ""
"Sometimes you might want your OnionShare service to be accessible to the "
"public, like if you want to set up an OnionShare receive service so the "
"public can securely and anonymously send you files. In this case, it's "
"better to disable the password altogether. If you don't do this, someone can "
"force your server to stop just by making 20 wrong guesses of your password, "
"even if they know the correct password."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/advanced.rst:35

"To turn off the password for any tab, just check the \"Don't use a password"

"**Scheduling an OnionShare service to automatically start can be used as a "
