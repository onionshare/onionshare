"You can toggle on the switch \"Connect to Tor automatically\" before "

"connection fails, you can still try bridges or reconfigure Tor via the "
"\"Network Settings\" button."
msgstr ""
"您可以在点击\"Connect to Tor\"之前，打开\"Connect to Tor automatically\"的开"
"关。这意味着下次OnionShare启动时，它将自动使用上次会话的Tor连接设置进行连接，"
"而不会呈现连接选项给您。如果连接失败，您仍然可以尝试使用桥接或通过\"Network "

"You can click \"Connect to Tor\" to begin the connection process. If there "

"When you click \"Connect to Tor\", if OnionShare fails to connect, it might "

"The other two options will attempt to automatically bypass censorship using "
"Tor bridges. If your network provider is blocking access to the Tor network, "
"you can hopefully still connect to a Tor bridge, which will then connect you "
"to the Tor network, circumventing the censorship. Both of these options use "
"the Tor Project's Censorship Circumvention API to provide you with bridge "
"settings that should work for you. OnionShare will temporarily use the `Meek "
"<https://gitlab.torproject.org/legacy/trac/-/wikis/doc/meek/>`_ domain-"
"fronting proxy to make a non-Tor connection from your computer to Tor's "
"Censorship Circumvention API. The Meek proxy hides the fact that you are "

"If you choose \"Automatically determine my country from my IP address for "

msgstr ""

#: ../../source/tor.rst:54
msgid ""
"Even though it's hard for an adversary to discover where the Meek request is "
"going, this may still be risky for some users. Therefore, it is an opt-in "
"feature. The use of Meek and non-torified network requests are limited only "
"to making one or two requests to the Censorship Circumvention API. Then Meek "
"is stopped, and all further network requests happen over the Tor network."
