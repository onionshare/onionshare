"**Third parties don't have access to anything that happens in OnionShare.** "
"Using OnionShare means hosting services directly on your computer. When "
"sharing your files with OnionShare, they are not uploaded to any third-party "
"server. If you make an OnionShare chat room, your computer acts as a server "
"for that too. This avoids the traditional model of having to trust the "
"computers of others."

"**第三方无法访问 OnionShare 中发生的任何情况。**使用 OnionShare 意味着直接在"
"您的计算机上托管服务。当您使用 OnionShare 共享文件时，它们不会上传到任何第三"
"方服务器。如果您创建 OnionShare 聊天室，您的计算机也会充当聊天室的服务器。这"
"避免了必须信任他人计算机的传统模式。"

"**Network eavesdroppers can't spy on anything that happens in OnionShare in "
"transit.** The connection between the Tor onion service and Tor Browser is "
"end-to-end encrypted. This means network attackers can't eavesdrop on "
"anything except encrypted Tor traffic. Even if an eavesdropper is a "
"malicious rendezvous node used to connect the Tor Browser with OnionShare's "
"onion service, the traffic is encrypted using the onion service's private "
"key."

"**网路窃听者无法侦察 OnionShare 传输中发生的情况。 ** Tor 洋葱服务与 Tor 浏览"

"OnionShare user."

"**If an attacker learns about the onion service, they still can't access "
"anything.** Prior attacks against the Tor network to enumerate onion "
"services allowed attackers to discover private ``.onion`` addresses. To "
"access an OnionShare service from its address, the private key used for "
"client authentication must be guessed (unless the service is already made "
"public by turning off the private key -- see :ref:`turn_off_private_key`)."

"**即使攻击者了解了洋葱服务，他们仍然无法访问任何内容。**之前针对 Tor 网络枚举"

"**Communicating the OnionShare address and private key might not be secure."
"** Communicating the OnionShare address to people is the responsibility of "
"the OnionShare user. If sent insecurely (such as through an e-mail message "
"monitored by an attacker), an eavesdropper can tell that OnionShare is being "
"used. Eavesdroppers can access services that are still up by loading their "
"addresses and/or lost key in the Tor Browser. Avoid this by communicating "
"the address securely, via encrypted text message (probably with disappearing "
"messages enabled), encrypted e-mail, or in person. This isn't necessary when "
"using OnionShare for something that isn't secret."
msgstr ""
"**传递 OnionShare 地址和私钥可能不安全。**向人们传递 OnionShare 地址是 "
"OnionShare 用户的责任。如果以不安全的方式发送（例如通过攻击者监控的电子邮"
"件），窃听者可以知道正在使用 OnionShare。窃听者可以通过在 Tor 浏览器中加载他"
"们的地址和/或丢失的密钥来访问仍在运行的服务。通过加密文本消息（可能启用了消失"
"消息）、加密电子邮件或亲自安全传递达地址来避免这种情况。当使用 OnionShare 处"

"**Communicating the OnionShare address and private key might not be "
"anonymous.** Extra precaution must be taken to ensure the OnionShare address "
"is communicated anonymously. A new e-mail or chat account, only accessed "
"over Tor, can be used to share the address. This isn't necessary unless "
"anonymity is a goal."
msgstr ""
"**传递 OnionShare 地址和私钥可能不是匿名的。**必须采取额外的预防措施以确保 "
"OnionShare 地址是匿名传递的。可以使用仅通过 Tor 访问的新电子邮件或聊天账号来"
"分享地址。除非匿名是目标，否则没有必要这样做。"
