msgid "The people you send the URL to then copy and paste it into their `Tor Browser <https://www.torproject.org/>`_ to access the OnionShare service. Tor Browser will then prompt for the private key, which the people can also then copy and paste in."

msgid "If you run OnionShare on your laptop to send someone files, and then suspend it before the files are sent, the service will not be available until your laptop is unsuspended and on the internet again. OnionShare works best when working with people in real-time."

#: ../../source/features.rst:26
msgid "Because your own computer is the web server, *no third party can access anything that happens in OnionShare*, not even the developers of OnionShare. It's completely private. And because OnionShare is based on Tor onion services too, it also protects your anonymity. See the :doc:`security design </security>` for more info."

If you use this feature, OnionShare will make an HTTP POST request to this URL whenever someone submits files or messages. For example, if you want to get an encrypted text messaging on the messaging app `Keybase <https://keybase.io/>`_, you can start a conversation with `@webhookbot <https://keybase.io/webhookbot>`_, type ``!webhook create onionshare-alerts``, and it will respond with a URL.

#: ../../source/features.rst:83
msgid "Setting up an OnionShare receiving service is useful for journalists and others needing to securely accept documents from anonymous sources.

msgid "If you add an ``index.html`` file, it will render when someone loads your website. You should also include any other HTML files, CSS files, JavaScript files, and images that make up the website. (Note that OnionShare only supports hosting *static* websites. It can't host websites that execute code or use databases. So you can't for example use WordPress.)"

#: ../../source/features.rst:146
msgid "People can join the chat room by loading its OnionShare address in Tor Browser. The chat room requires JavasScript, so everyone who wants to participate must have their Tor Browser security level set to \"Standard\" or \"Safer\", instead of \"Safest\"."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/features.rst:149
msgid "When someone joins the chat room they get assigned a random name. They can change their name by typing a new name in the box in the left panel and pressing ↵. Since the chat history isn't saved anywhere, it doesn't get displayed at all, even if others were already chatting in the room."

msgstr ""

#: ../../source/features.rst:165
msgid "If you for example send a message to a Signal group, a copy of your message ends up on each device (the smartphones, and computers if they set up Signal Desktop) of each member of the group. Even if disappearing messages is turned on, it's hard to confirm all copies of the messages are actually deleted from all devices, and from any other places (like notifications databases) they may have been saved to. OnionShare chat rooms don't store any messages anywhere, so the problem is reduced to a minimum."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/features.rst:168

For example, a source can send an OnionShare address to a journalist using a disposable email address, and then wait for the journalist to join the chat room, all without compromosing their anonymity."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/features.rst:172
msgid "How does the encryption work?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/features.rst:174
msgid "Because OnionShare relies on Tor onion services, connections between the Tor Browser and OnionShare are all end-to-end encrypted (E2EE). When someone posts a message to an OnionShare chat room, they send it to the server through the E2EE onion connection, which then sends it to all other members of the chat room using WebSockets, through their E2EE onion connections."
