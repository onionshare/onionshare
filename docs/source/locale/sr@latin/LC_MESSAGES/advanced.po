"By default, everything in OnionShare is temporary. As soon as you close "
"an OnionShare tab its address no longer exists and can't be used again. "
"But sometimes you might want an OnionShare service to be persistent. For "
"example, this would be useful if you want to host a website that can keep"
" the same URL even if you reboot your computer."

"By default, all OnionShare services are protected with the username "

"But sometimes you might want your OnionShare service to be accessible to "
"the public. For example, if you want to set up an OnionShare receive "
"service so the public can securely and anonymously send you files. In "
"this case, it's better to disable the password altogether. If you don't "
"do this, someone can force your server to stop just by making 20 wrong "
"guesses of your password, even if they know the correct password."
