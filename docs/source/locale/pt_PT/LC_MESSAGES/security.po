"**Network eavesdroppers can't spy on anything that happens in OnionShare in "
"transit.** The connection between the Tor onion service and Tor Browser is "
"end-to-end encrypted. This means network attackers can't eavesdrop on "
"anything except encrypted Tor traffic. Even if an eavesdropper is a "
"malicious rendezvous node used to connect the Tor Browser with OnionShare's "
"onion service, the traffic is encrypted using the onion service's private "
"key."

"**Os bisbilhoteiros da rede não podem espionar nada que aconteça no "
"OnionShare durante o trânsito.** A conexão entre o serviço onion Tor e o Tor "
"Browser são encriptados de ponta-a-ponta. Isso significa que os invasores da "
"rede não podem espiar nada, exceto o tráfego encriptado do Tor. Mesmo se um "
"bisbilhoteiro for um nó de encontro malicioso usado para conectar o Tor "
"Browser ao serviço onion da OnionShare, o tráfego é encriptado usando a "
"chave privada do serviço onion."

"**Anonymity of OnionShare users are protected by Tor.** OnionShare and Tor "
"Browser protect the anonymity of the users. As long as the OnionShare user "
"anonymously communicates the OnionShare address with the Tor Browser users, "

"OnionShare user."

"**O anonimato dos utilizadores do OnionShare são protegidos pelo Tor.** O "
"OnionShare e o Tor Browser protegem o anonimato dos utilizadores. Enquanto o "

"bisbilhoteiros não podem saber a identidade do utilizador do OnionShare."

"**If an attacker learns about the onion service, it still can't access "
"anything.** Prior attacks against the Tor network to enumerate onion "
"services allowed the attacker to discover private .onion addresses. If an "
"attack discovers a private OnionShare address, a password will be prevent "
"them from accessing it (unless the OnionShare user chooses to turn it off "
"and make it public). The password is generated by choosing two random words "
"from a list of 6800 words, making 6800², or about 46 million possible "
"passwords. Only 20 wrong guesses can be made before OnionShare stops the "
"server, preventing brute force attacks against the password."
