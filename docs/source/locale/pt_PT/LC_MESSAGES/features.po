"OnionShare chat rooms can also be useful for people wanting to chat "
"anonymously and securely with someone without needing to create any "
"accounts. For example, a source can send an OnionShare address to a "
"journalist using a disposable email address, and then wait for the "
"journalist to join the chat room, all without compromosing their anonymity."
