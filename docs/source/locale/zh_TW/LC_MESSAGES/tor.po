"The other two options will attempt to automatically bypass censorship using "
"Tor bridges. If your network provider is blocking access to the Tor network, "
"you can hopefully still connect to a Tor bridge, which will then connect you "

"the Tor Project's Censorship Circumvention API to provide you with bridge "

"<https://gitlab.torproject.org/legacy/trac/-/wikis/doc/meek/>`_ domain-"
