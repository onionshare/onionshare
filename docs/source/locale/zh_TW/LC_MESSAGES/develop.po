"OnionShare has an open Keybase team that we use to discuss the project, "
"including asking questions, sharing ideas and designs, and making plans "

"encrypted direct messages to others in the OnionShare community, like "
"OnionShare addresses.) To use Keybase, you need to download the `Keybase "
"app <https://keybase.io/download>`_, make an account, and `join this team"
" <https://keybase.io/team/onionshare>`_. Within the app, go to Teams, "
"click \"Join a Team\", and type \"onionshare\"."
