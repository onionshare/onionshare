"**Third parties don't have access to anything that happens in OnionShare.** "
"Using OnionShare means hosting services directly on your computer. When "
"sharing files with OnionShare, they are not uploaded to any server. If you "
"make an OnionShare chat room, your computer acts as a server for that too. "
"This avoids the traditional model of having to trust the computers of others."

"**Network eavesdroppers can't spy on anything that happens in OnionShare in "
"transit.** The connection between the Tor onion service and Tor Browser is "
"end-to-end encrypted. This means network attackers can't eavesdrop on "
"anything except encrypted Tor traffic. Even if an eavesdropper is a "
"malicious rendezvous node used to connect the Tor Browser with OnionShare's "
"onion service, the traffic is encrypted using the onion service's private "
"key."

"**網路竊聽者無法偵察 OnionShare 傳輸中發生的情況。** Tor 洋蔥服務與 Tor 瀏覽"
"器之間的連接為端到端加密，這代表 網路攻擊者除了加密的 Tor 流量無法竊聽任何東"
"西，即便攻擊者是 Tor 瀏覽器與 OnionShare 洋蔥服務連接的惡意會合節點，其流量也"
"使用洋蔥服務私鑰加密。"

"**Anonymity of OnionShare users are protected by Tor.** OnionShare and Tor "
"Browser protect the anonymity of the users. As long as the OnionShare user "
"anonymously communicates the OnionShare address with the Tor Browser users, "
"the Tor Browser users and eavesdroppers can't learn the identity of the "
"OnionShare user."

"**OnionShare 使用者的匿名受到 Tor 保護。** OnionShare 與 Tor 瀏覽器保護使用者"

"**If an attacker learns about the onion service, it still can't access "
"anything.** Prior attacks against the Tor network to enumerate onion "
"services allowed the attacker to discover private .onion addresses. If an "
"attack discovers a private OnionShare address, a password will be prevent "
"them from accessing it (unless the OnionShare user chooses to turn it off "
"and make it public). The password is generated by choosing two random words "
"from a list of 6800 words, making 6800², or about 46 million possible "
"passwords. Only 20 wrong guesses can be made before OnionShare stops the "
"server, preventing brute force attacks against the password."

"**Communicating the OnionShare address might not be secure.** Communicating "
"the OnionShare address to people is the responsibility of the OnionShare "
"user. If sent insecurely (such as through an email message monitored by an "
"attacker), an eavesdropper can tell that OnionShare is being used. If the "
"eavesdropper loads the address in Tor Browser while the service is still up, "
"they can access it. To avoid this, the address must be communicateed "
"securely, via encrypted text message (probably with disappearing messages "
"enabled), encrypted email, or in person. This isn't necessary when using "
"OnionShare for something that isn't secret."

"**Communicating the OnionShare address might not be anonymous.** Extra "
"precautions must be taken to ensure the OnionShare address is communicated "
"anonymously. A new email or chat account, only accessed over Tor, can be "
"used to share the address. This isn't necessary unless anonymity is a goal."
