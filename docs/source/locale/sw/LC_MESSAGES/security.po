"**Third parties don't have access to anything that happens in OnionShare.** "
"Using OnionShare means hosting services directly on your computer. When "
"sharing your files with OnionShare, they are not uploaded to any third-party "
"server. If you make an OnionShare chat room, your computer acts as a server "
"for that too. This avoids the traditional model of having to trust the "
"computers of others."

"**Network eavesdroppers can't spy on anything that happens in OnionShare in "
"transit.** The connection between the Tor onion service and Tor Browser is "
"end-to-end encrypted. This means network attackers can't eavesdrop on "
"anything except encrypted Tor traffic. Even if an eavesdropper is a "
"malicious rendezvous node used to connect the Tor Browser with OnionShare's "
"onion service, the traffic is encrypted using the onion service's private "
"key."

"**Wafuatiliaji wa mtandao hawawezi kuchunguza chochote kinachoendelea katika "
"OnionShare inayosafiri.** Mawasiliano kati ya Tor onion service na Tor "
"Browser ni kati ya pande mbili tu na yamesimbwa. Hii inamaanisha wavamizi wa "
"mtandaoni hawawezi kufuatilia chochote isipokuwa usafirishaji wa data za Tor "
"zilizosimbwa. Hata kama mfuatiliaji ni node za kutafutana zisizo salama "
"ambazo hutumika kuunganisha Tor Browser na Onion services za OnionShare, "
"usafirishaji wa data umesimbwa kwa kutumia private key ya onion service's."

"**Anonymity of OnionShare users are protected by Tor.** OnionShare and Tor "
"Browser protect the anonymity of the users. As long as the OnionShare user "
"anonymously communicates the OnionShare address with the Tor Browser users, "
"the Tor Browser users and eavesdroppers can't learn the identity of the "
"OnionShare user."

"**Kutojulikana kwawatumiaji wa OnionShare kunalindwa na Tor.** OnionShare na "
"Tor Browser hulinda kutojulikana kwa watumiaji. Kwakuwa watumiaji wa "
"OnionShare bila kujulikana hujiunganisha na anwani za OnionShare na "
"watumaiji wa Tor Browser, watumiaji wa Tor Browser na wafuatiliaji hawawezi "
"kujua utambulisho wa mtumiaji wa OnionShare."

"**If an attacker learns about the onion service, they still can't access "
"anything.** Prior attacks against the Tor network to enumerate onion "
"services allowed attackers to discover private ``.onion`` addresses. To "
"access an OnionShare service from its address, the private key used for "
"client authentication must be guessed (unless the service is already made "
"public by turning off the private key -- see :ref:`turn_off_private_key`)."

"**Communicating the OnionShare address and private key might not be secure."
"** Communicating the OnionShare address to people is the responsibility of "
"the OnionShare user. If sent insecurely (such as through an e-mail message "
"monitored by an attacker), an eavesdropper can tell that OnionShare is being "
"used. Eavesdroppers can access services that are still up by loading their "
"addresses and/or lost key in the Tor Browser. Avoid this by communicating "
"the address securely, via encrypted text message (probably with disappearing "
"messages enabled), encrypted e-mail, or in person. This isn't necessary when "
"using OnionShare for something that isn't secret."

"**Communicating the OnionShare address and private key might not be "
"anonymous.** Extra precaution must be taken to ensure the OnionShare address "
"is communicated anonymously. A new e-mail or chat account, only accessed "
"over Tor, can be used to share the address. This isn't necessary unless "
"anonymity is a goal."
