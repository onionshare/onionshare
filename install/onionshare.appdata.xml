        <p>
            OnionShare lets you securely and anonymously share a file of any size with someone. It works
            by starting a web server, making it accessible as a Tor hidden service, and generating an
            unguessable URL to access and download the file.
        </p>
        <p>
            It doesn't require setting up a server on the internet somewhere or using a third party
            filesharing service. You host the file on your own computer and use a Tor hidden service to
            make it temporarily accessible over the internet. The other user just needs to use Tor Browser
            to download the file from you.
        </p>
